<p>The People’s Republic of China’s ruling party, the Chinese Communist Party
(CCP) consistently and proudly calls itself a democracy. However, in the West,
it is obvious to see that there is little parallel in what is defined as a democracy
here, and the structure in China seen today. Equally puzzling, the democratic
movements in China from the Democracy Wall movement in 1978-1979 to the
Tiananmen Square protests in 1989 were cracked down on specifically with the
rhetoric of democracy by the Chinese government. A closer look at the Chinese
government’s ideology and their understanding of democracy reveals that there
is an internal logic there within all of these parties which use the common
language of &ldquo;democracy.&rdquo; The content of the language used shows that what
&ldquo;democracy&rdquo; means to different groups varies wildly, and that using solely the
term &ldquo;democracy&rdquo; may not be enough to describe fully the sheer diversity seen
in China.</p>
<h1 id="meaning-of-democracy-in-china">Meaning of Democracy in China</h1>
<p>Democracy is rendered in Chinese as &ldquo;minzhu&rdquo;, which is composed of two
characters: &ldquo;min&rdquo; and &ldquo;zhu.&rdquo; In Chinese language, a single character can have
many varying definitions, and these characters are no different. Depending on
context and usage, the character &ldquo;min&rdquo; can mean &ldquo;common people&rdquo; as opposed
to &ldquo;officials&rdquo;, the &ldquo;people&rdquo; as opposed to &ldquo;class enemies,&rdquo; or the &ldquo;individual&rdquo; as
opposed to the &ldquo;collective.&rdquo; (Guang 1996, p. 422). Similarly, the character for
&ldquo;zhu&rdquo; can mean either &ldquo;master,&rdquo; which means being in charge, or &ldquo;primary&rdquo; which
does not necessarily mean in charge, but taken as the most important topic of
concern. (Guang 1996, p. 420) This much variation in the basic components
of the word for &ldquo;democracy&rdquo; means that in Chinese culture, democracy can
be interpreted quite differently by different groups, or even the same group
but at different points in time. It makes sense then to contrast the Western
conception of &ldquo;democracy&rdquo; to the Chinese conception of &ldquo;minzhu,&rdquo; as ideas which
are clearly related and in constant discussion with one another, but nonetheless
fundamentally differ from one another. (Guang 1996, p. 440-442)</p>
<p>The internal diversity and discussion surrounding China’s own discussion of
democracy is also seen in the multiple democracy movements from 1978 to 1989.
While the CCP had a consistent view how its institutions were democratic, as
a result of differing definitions of what democracy entailed by other groups in
China, under differing influences, there have been multiple incidents all revolving
around the idea of &ldquo;democracy.&rdquo; For example, in the Democracy Wall movement
from 1978 to 1979, was formed from a coalition of a diverse set of actors each
operating under their conception of democracy, ranging from orthodox Marxist
to and Western human rights’ standpoints, each with influence from Chinese
traditional ideas of rights and the relation between the people and government.
(Guang 1996, p. 432)</p>
<p>The traditional Chinese idea which influenced most of these discussions was
the idea of &ldquo;minben,&rdquo; which along with the previous character of &ldquo;min&rdquo; put
together with &ldquo;ben&rdquo; which means &ldquo;root&rdquo; or &ldquo;basis.&rdquo; (Guang 1996, p. 421) This
means to put the welfare of the people as the basis of the government. There
is inherently a paternalist tone to the idea as it assumes a dichotomy between
the state and the people, with the state held responsible for the well being
of the people, without any suggestion of the people holding the government
accountable, or having any role in it. (Guang 1996, p. 423)</p>
<p>The party’s conception of democracy was clearly influenced by both Marxist
ideology and minben, by both using the Leninist language of the vanguard party,
and also that their role was purely in the interest of the people’s welfare, albeit
without their participation. (Guang 1996, p. 432)</p>
<p>The democracy movements which challenged this idea of democracy, also
differed quite a bit how they thought of democracy within themselves. The
Marxist elements of the Democracy Wall movement, understood &ldquo;minzhu&rdquo; as
consistently not of the &ldquo;common people&rdquo; being &ldquo;primary,&rdquo; but rather them be-
ing the &ldquo;masters.&rdquo; (Guang 1996, p. 422) This would be achieved through an
implementation of Paris Commune style communism or Yugoslavian commu-
nism where the workers managed their own affairs, and officials were elected,
not appointed. (Guang 1996, p. 431) Another idea was to have a multiparty
system, but each operating under the common interest of the people, differing
only in the strategy of working towards that goal. The influence of traditional
Confucian values of &ldquo;harmony&rdquo; and &ldquo;collective welfare&rdquo; can be seen here as they
formulated their arguments as not promoting the individual and their rights,
but rather to have the collective wellbeing of society be the ultimate interest of
these parties.</p>
<p>The Tiananmen Square movement of 1989 had some continuities with the
Democracy Wall movement, such as their nationalism and working towards the
ultimate well being of society as a whole. However, their discourse notably took
on much more Western conceptions of democracy. For example, the topic of &ldquo;hu-
man rights,&rdquo; which was an idea rarely used in Chinese discourse, was prominent
in this movement. They argued that true democracy was done through having
procedures in place to have the people hold the government accountable, and
ensuring that the government worked to uphold their human rights. (Guang
1996, p. 433)</p>
<p>Thus, the discussion of &ldquo;democracy&rdquo; in China is nebulous, often shifting
according to the time, and under differing influences such as Marxism, Western
human rights discourse, and traditional Confucianism.</p>
<h1 id="the-partys-criticism">The Party&rsquo;s Criticism</h1>
<p>The Chinese Communist Party identified these movements and their deviations from the CCP’s definition of democracy to be dangerous, therefore
worked relentlessly to criticize them. The most basic differentiation they created to counter these arguments was between &ldquo;socialist democracy&rdquo; and &ldquo;bourgeois democracy.&rdquo; (Sun 1995, p. 159) They argued that what makes socialist
democracy superior to bourgeois democracy, Western liberal democracy, was
class. Under a Marxist framework, everything has a class element to them,
democracy included. (Sun 1995, p. 149) In a socialist democracy, the party
acting as a vanguard party only has the people’s interest, and no interests of
its own. (Nathan 1986, p. 181) However, the party also does not blindly follow
the people. It is this way that the party is democratic, and procedures have no
role in determining if a system is democratic or not, because the procedures can
work for or against the people’s interests. (Nathan 1986, p. 182)</p>
<p>Furthermore as a vanguard party, they are intrinsically linked to the state,
and their position as the sole ruling party guarantees stability and security, and
through that, the ability to work in the interests of the people. (Nathan 1986,
p. 153)</p>
<p>Another element of socialist democracy is that since the workers have ownership of the means of production, that guarantees their social justice better
than bourgeois democracy could where there is private ownership of the means
of production. (Nathan 1986, p. 182, Sun 1995, p. 231) This is since private
ownership of the means of production would inevitably lead to a bourgeois class
and an undemocratic institution in the end.</p>
<p>Through these arguments, the CCP justified their crushing of democratic
movements in the country. They argued that a bipartisan Marxist democracy as
was suggested by some in the Democracy Wall movement would undermine the
CCP’s position as the vanguard party, and along with it the very existence of the
state which would lead to more chaos. (Nathan 1986, p. 152) They also criticized
emulating the multiparty democracies of Western countries, because while they
seem to represent different interest groups, in practice, they have a common
interest in promoting capitalism, and the only group that gets represented ends
up being the bourgeois as they are the only group which have the resources
to run for office and pay for campaigns in a multiparty electoral system. (Sun
1995, p. 231, 234)</p>
<p>Nearly a decade later, the CCP would use similar arguments to justify their
crackdown on the Tiananmen Square protestors, along with the further criticism
of their demand for a more procedural democracy with special protections for
human rights. (Guang 1996, p. 435) However, the CCP argued that what rights
are afforded to the people are dependent on the conditions of the state. (Nathan
1986, p. 155) Therefore, what human rights exist are developed alongside the
development of the state</p>
<h1 id="comparison-to-western-democracy">Comparison to Western Democracy</h1>
<p>Along with the criticism of their internal democratic movements, the party
also criticized Western liberal democracy, which many of these movements were
influenced by, and took inspiration from. As mentioned before, Western liberal democracy is characterized by two main elements: procedures and rights.
Democracy exists to protect the natural rights of the people from the government, and this is done through a set of procedures to the government accountable to the will of the people. Both of these processes were criticized by the
CCP within a Marxist framework which also took influence from traditional
Chinese political tradition.</p>
<p>Firstly, the idea of &ldquo;natural rights&rdquo; was criticized for it led to the develop
ment of a bourgeois capitalist mode of production, and could not guarantee
social justice or equitable distribution of wealth. (Sun 1995, p. 231) Socialist
democracy guaranteed both social justice and equitable distribution through
public ownership. In addition, &ldquo;rights&rdquo; in Chinese political tradition derived
from the government’s obligation to the people, rather than any inherent human
existence. (Nathan 1986, p. 155) Thus, rights are granted by the government
for the purpose of better functioning of itself, rather than in the Western context
where rights are granted to protect the people the government. (Nathan 1986,
p. 156) Therefore, the CCP can justify the limiting of certain rights if it meant
the healthy functioning of the government, and by extension, the state.</p>
<p>Secondly, prominent aspects of Western liberal democracy such as a parliamentary system, or electoral process were criticized. The parliamentary system
was criticized for only allowing for a coordination between the ruling class, and
the electoral process existing only to provide legitimacy to the perpetuation of
their interests in the political realm. (Sun 1995, p. 231) Thereby, the party justified their stance against the emulation of Western democracy, and the further
criticize the democratic movements within the country.</p>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>Democracy is a highly variable concept, and difficult to nail down in the Chinese context. Not only does the concept of democracy (minzhu) differ highly
from how it is defined in the West, even within the country among different
groups it is defined differently depending on their influences from other traditions whether it be Marxism, Chinese tradition, or Western tradition. This
tension between the differing interpretations of what democracy is has led to
the formation of several democratic movements in China, and their subsequent
crushing by the CCP.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is important to note that these &ldquo;democratic&rdquo; movements were
advocating for a model of democracy that is notably different to what is traditionally seen as &ldquo;democracy&rdquo; in the West. If the goal is to achieve democracy in
China, then there should be a shift from seeing these movements unqualifiedly
as &ldquo;democratic&rdquo; to a term which is able to better capture their content. In the
West, the definition of democracy is consistent and has a firm grounding in
Western liberal tradition, however in China, it is not consistent, and what is
&ldquo;democracy&rdquo; may shift from one movement to another.</p>
