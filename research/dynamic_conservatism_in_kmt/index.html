<p>The former ruling party of Kuomintang (KMT) in Taiwan has shifted in its policies and role wildly in its history while retaining their core identity and values, a pattern which has been described by some authors as “dynamic conservatism.” While often used to describe the way in which the KMT has adapted after events such as their move to Taiwan and during democratization, it has not been used in recent years. The election of Tsai Ing-wen was such significant moment which Taiwan observers suggest could force the KMT to rethink their position once more, especially their Cross-Straits policies. Using discourse analysis to examine various public speeches and interviews of KMT leaders which concern Cross-Strait politics, during Ma Ying-jeou’s presidency and after Tsai Ing-wen’s election, many commonalities in language use can be noted. However, at the same time, the context in which these terms and concepts are used has notably changed and suggests a different ideology underneath. These findings suggest conservatism dynamism is still a valid concept through which to analyze the KMT’s discourse surrounding their Cross-Strait policies. This adaptability should be noted for future analysis of what Taiwanese Cross-Strait policies might appear from a likely KMT government in the future which has a direct effect on US-China relations.</p>
