			<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>Ever since the Kuomintang (KMT) fled to the island of Taiwan in 1949, it
has been the sole party in power until moves towards democratization in the 80s.
While the present liberal democracy status of Taiwan is unquestionable, there
are still remnants from the old party rule which prevents further democratization
in Taiwanese politics. Every step of the way from the establishment of the
Republic of China in Taiwan, to its eventual democratization, local factionalism
has been a key element in the KMT’s hold on power and electoral strategy. It has
been argued that while the support for the Democratical Progress Party (DPP)
party, the current party in power, is based in ideology, the KMT’s support is
still &ldquo;faction based,&rdquo; as in that it relies on local factional mobilization to elect
officials. (Bosco 1994, p. 31) Despite its undemocratic nature, as it does not
rely on the democratic process to get officials elected, in fact this was one of
the factors which helped the Taiwanese political system to democratize since
the party was willing to let political change happen knowing it had the network
necessary to get their politicians elected. (Bosco 1994, p. 30) However, in the
modern day, the KMT has still yet to become a &ldquo;normal&rdquo; party, since it still
holds on to its strong local factional presence and mobilization strategies.</p>
<h1 id="faction">Faction</h1>
<p>The definition for &ldquo;faction&rdquo; used here, is that of Bosco’s study into the fac-
tions of Taiwan, where he notes it to be a &ldquo;political conflict group that are
not corporate and whose members are recruited by a leader on diverse princi-
ples.&rdquo; (Bosco 2016, p. 1) Furthermore a &ldquo;local faction&rdquo; is a set of interpersonal
networks that function, for political purposes, in the local as opposed to the
national arena. (Chen 2016, p. 224) These factions originate from pre-existing
networks in the local level even before the KMT’s escape to the island. But
they formed into existence around when the very first elections were held at the
local level. They are usually limited to the county and township level, because
the KMT wanted to eliminate any factionalism greater than the county level.
These factions then mobilize votes in the village level through local leaders.</p>
<p>When the KMT first moved to Taiwan, they were an outsider to the island
and had no connection with the locals. As a way to build legitimacy and connect
with the local population, the KMT co-opted the local loose personal relations
which already existed on the local level to mobilize them to vote in their favor in
elections. As return, the KMT would provide various economic benefits. (Chen
2016) It also provided a look of democracy for the KMT government which was
in alliance with other democratic states. (Cheng 1989, p. 478)</p>
<p>Factional leaders are nearly all members of the KMT, and are more cohesive
than factions than other countries. (Bosco 2016, p. 2) Ever since their co-
option, local factions have been critical to sustaining the KMT rule on the
island. During the latter half of the KMT rule on the island, nearly 60% of
KMT nominated candidates were faction affiliated. The members of the faction
can be expected to receive rewards should they be victorious, especially in terms
of jobs which is the most common patronage type. (Bosco 2016, p. 8) There
are also cases of vote buying wherein a rural voter may receive gifts, including
cash in hongbaos, &ldquo;ren envelopes,&rdquo; for supporting a certain candidate.</p>
<p>All this worked to establish a strictly local system of clientelism between the
KMT party and local leaders, as well the voters they mobilize.</p>
<h1 id="transition-to-democracy">Transition to Democracy</h1>
<p>The client system worked well to consolidate the KMT’s political power
over Taiwanese society, which in turn was instrumental in its path to economic
development. (Cheng 1989, p. 480) Their GDP was growing at an average rate
of 9% from 1960 to 1980. This led to a new middle class, but not only that the
demographics of those with economic power were now mainly the Taiwanese,
not the mainlander demographic of those in political power. (Cheng 1989, p.
483) This new demographic educated in the social sciences, demanded for a
liberal democracy to take place in the Taiwanese government structure.</p>
<p>In response to these demands, the KMT attempted to co-opt the activists
by ceding some political reforms such as more supplementary elections. The
KMT still banned opposition parties, and to prevent the opposition forces from
organizing themselves into parties, they instead tried to send them through
the KMT system as new candidates. (Cheng 1989, p. 487) This might have
backfired however as this meant that soon enough there were Taiwanese political
elites who had much more of a sense of a separate Taiwanese identity than a
Chinese one. Through a careful and complicated bargaining process between
the growing opposition and the KMT, eventually the first competitive election
in Taiwan’s history was held in 1986.</p>
<p>Another concession made by the KMT was to grant the local factions to form
island-wide alliance whereas before they were restricted to the local counties and
townships. This led to the development of factions around Taiwan which did
not necessarily have to align themselves with the KMT, but which nonetheless
still generally kept their old networks. (Chen 2016)</p>
<h1 id="current-day">Current Day</h1>
<p>In the current day, the local electoral advantages that the KMT enjoyed is
still felt today. When it comes to island-wide elections, it is often the leading
opposition party, the Democratic Progress Party (DPP), who has the advantage
since it relies on ideological and political appeal to gain voters. Those who have
the education to think about political and ideological issues to vote are therefore
likely to vote DPP. Factions also tend to be weaker in cities, since the social
networks that a voter is tied is much more complex than in villages or counties.
(Bosco 1994, p. 45-6) Both of these factors lead to the DPP appealing to
urban voters in general who tend to be more educated and less susceptible to
factionalism. Therefore the KMT has to rely more on its local factions to stay
in power and hold on to seats.</p>
<p>A consequence of its relationship has been that factions has used its new-
found independence, since it is no longer restricted to a locality, to gain a lever-
age over the KMT. (Rigger 2005, p. 320 This means that the KMT is increasing
relying on self-interested factions to hold on to power, and further strengthening
the patron-client relationships. The KMT, during the 1991 National Assembly
elections, even strunk the size of electoral districts, to lend more power to the
factional mobilization strategy. (Bosco 1994, p. 59) This further strengthens
the factions and local interests, and shows the KMT’s reliance on these factions
for votes.</p>
<p>Despite Taiwan being a vibrant democracy today with competitive elections,
the parties are still not on completely equal ground as they approach elections.
The KMT’s political strategies from its party dictatorship era still hold in to-
day’s elections. Factional mobilization strategy that relies on a patron-client
system with a dominant party is even more important to the KMT now. This
means that during elections, the strategy for both parties look different from
each other. The DPP uses the democratic process of political campaigns and
ideological arguments to win over voters in urban districts, while the KMT’s pol-
itics are tied down to pleasing local leaders and giving out tributes to maintain
their support.</p>
<p>There are still further changes which could be had to improve the democratic
institutions in Taiwan. The KMT has relied on the factions to stay in power
despite strong opposition up until now. But the system which relies on is one
filled with corruption rather than a clear democratic process. Until the point in
which the KMT can get rid of its factional reliance and compete with the DPP
or any other party on the same level, the democratic transition away from the
KMT is still not fully done.</p>
