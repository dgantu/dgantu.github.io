			<p>It is clear to those who have either studied both a Turkic and Mongolic language or has an interest in linguistic, especially historical, that there is a deep connection between these language families. Personally, my language learning journey of Azerbaijani has already many common vocabulary between it and Mongolian, despite the short length of my study. Turkic countries generally seem to be aware of this fact, but Mongolia largely seems to be unaware of their linguistic connection to the Turkic world.</p>
<p>Bringing this connection to public awareness would lend strong legitimacy to a greater cooperation between Mongolia and Central Asian countries, especially cooperation based on Inner Asian pan-nationalism, commonly referred as Turanism. Below is an extensive discussion of the technical linguistic connections between Turkic and Mongolic languages, then followed by how they may practically affect how Turanism is received in Central Asian countries.</p>
<h1 id="linguistics">Linguistics</h1>
<h2 id="loans">Loans</h2>
<p>The linguistic connections between Mongolic and Turkic is primarily based on two properties common to both language families: vocabulary, and grammar structure. Common vocabulary is the easiest to explain on the surface but also something one can dive quite deep into. Most common type of shared vocabulary represented are Turkic loans into Mongolic, and these words have been continually borrowed over the course of several hundred years, although there loans into Turkic from Mongolic as well, especially on the eastern varieties.. Because of this, the Turkic loans in Mongolic can be divided into several layers, pre-Proto-Mongolic, Proto-Mongolic, and post-Mongol Invasions. The deeper one goes in the layer, the more difficult it becomes to identify a word as a cognate.</p>
<p>For example, cognates in the pre-Proto-Mongolic stage, despite looking completely unrelated, such as Proto-Mongolic *<em>čilagun</em> &lsquo;stone&rsquo; and Proto Turkic *<em>tiāĺ</em> id. are actually related. To make sense of it as a cognate, several overlapping processes must understood. First, is that rather than Common Turkic languages, which nearly every modern Turkic language is, pre-Proto-Mongolic languages extensively borrowed from Oghur Turkic languages, which stand out in contrast to even other Turkic languages. Oghur Turkic langauges are characterized by *<em>l</em> in place of *<em>š</em> in Common Turkic. As a result, the -l- in the Proto-Mongolic word unexpectedly corresponds to -š- in most modern Turkic languages. Secondly, every Mongolic language exhibits palatalization of alveolar stops (t, d) in front of &lsquo;i&rsquo;. So *<em>ti-</em> in Proto-Turkic corresponds to *<em>či-</em> in Mongolic. With later developments in the languages applied, the modern reflexes of these words turns out to be &ldquo;čuluu&rdquo; in Modern Mongolian, and &ldquo;taş&rdquo; in Turkish. Related, yet completely different.</p>
<p>In contrast to these deep early loanwords, the words of the later stages becomes easily identifiable by lay people, sometimes even resulting in almost the exact same pronunciation. These cognates are extensive due to the incorporation of Turkic tribes into the Mongol Empire, during and after which these loans were taken. Since these loans were between Common Turkic languages and Mongolic languages, their modern reflexes still strongly resemble each other. Some extremely obvious cognates are</p>
<ul>
<li>Mongolic &ldquo;*<em>tani-</em>&rdquo; &lsquo;to recognize, to know&rsquo; &lt; Common Turkic &ldquo;*<em>tanï-</em>&rdquo; id.,</li>
<li>Mongolic &ldquo;*<em>alima</em>&rdquo; &lsquo;apple&rsquo; &lt; Turkic &ldquo;*<em>alma</em>&rdquo; id.</li>
<li>Turkic &ldquo;*<em>aral</em>&rdquo; &lsquo;island&rsquo; &lt; Mongolic &ldquo;*<em>aral</em>&rdquo; id.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="altaic">Altaic</h2>
<p>Beyond these loanwords, let us discuss the obvious controversy of the Altaic language family, or the Transeurasian languages as it has been referred to recently. While the fact that there were heavy borrowings between these languages of Eurasia, some linguists propose that looking deeper into them reveals a genetic relationship between them. The language families often included in Altaic are Turkic, Mongolic, and Tungusic languages of  Siberia and Manchuria. Koreanic and Japonic are sometimes includes as well. This grouping is often controversial since the word comparisons between these languages often rely on exaggerated semantic shifts and dubious sound correspondences.</p>
<p>Altaic languages, should they be accepted by the mainstream academic opinion, would certain yield great credibility to Turanic ideas since it would be providing academic support to a common origin between Turkic and Mongolic cultures. Many groups adopt this position of accepting Altaic languageswith some variations as a valid grouping to promote their version of pan-Nationalism. The ideology of the Jobbik party of Hungary, a Hungarian nationalist party, takes the position that &ldquo;Uralic people&rdquo;, including the Hungarian nation, originate from a wider Uralo-Altaic people. This is used to lend support to policies favoring greater connection with Turkey and Central Asian countries.</p>
<p>But, for Turko-Mongolic relations, whether or not their language families share a common origin is not as important. The fact that Turkic and Mongolic groups have had contact with each other and intercultural exchanges is already commonly accepted by mainstream academia. Genetic relations in the linguistic or the biological sense does not have to be the main pillar of Turanism, but may serve as a supporting beam. Having such deep cultural and linguistic connections is already evidence enough to lend support to Turanic cooperation between these two societies.</p>
<h1 id="nationalism">Nationalism</h1>
<p>With the linguistic connections between the two language families established, these facts must now be properly deployed to politically legitimize Turko-Mongolic nationalism. .</p>
