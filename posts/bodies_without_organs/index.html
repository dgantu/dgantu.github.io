                    <p>The primary unit of international relations is the state.
The state forms with the monopolization of legitimate violence in an area.
The concept of legitimacy is imagined here as the Deleuzian concept of a
body-without-organs. The organs form the structure of how legitimacy is
used as a function.
The organization of organs upon the body, I call a monad, borrowing from
functional programming. Sites of mobilization, I define as separate
bodies but as part of legitimacy as a body as a whole, in
a more coherent sense, such as race, gender, religion, and so on.</p>
<p>The monad arises from sites of mobilization, such as may be created by sudden
power vacuums, or a line of flight, and finds in it
a potential for mobilization and subjects them to the monad. The subject in
turn gives to the monad the capability to mobilize it as well as a certain
subjectivity. It is the
function of the organ that sets the narrative of the body&rsquo;s organization,
that limits either the immediate material expansion of that body or its
abstract virtual expansion to an extent. There is also a degree of gravity
from material flow in that organ on sites of mobilization, by which
more subjects on the body are drawn to it. Note that without the flow
on the body, it is free to give way to new organs and new subjectivities.</p>
<p>The modern state is an amalgam of interworking and self-supporting sites
of mobilization, which it has chosen to engage in and abstracted out a certain
shape outward to embody. It is interworking and self-supporting in the
sense that it often pushes to allow for a greater degree of coherence to
the capability and capacity of the body, which is how nationalism,
as an organ functions. Subjectivity is borne out of these pre-existing
bodies, individually and organizationally. It makes a great deal of sense
then that states will engage in sites that afford them the most capability
and capacity. Similarly, the states must also be careful to balance their
material flow onto these sites and for the potential of subjects
themselves to project a virtual abstraction of the body, a way in which it
may be organized, from which a new subjectivity can arise materially.</p>
<p>A site of mobilization of limitless size in
virtuality may push the organization to behave in a way each of its organs
would not in isolation. For example, the American state, through its
claim to universality
has derived an immense amount of legitimacy historically, and from its
historical legacies still continue to hold the material gravitational pull.
But if there is to be strategic solvency in American material flow commitments
there must also be a solvency in which sites the state chooses to engage in
where legitimacy exists as a body. Past American failures in the Middle East
can be characterized by huge lines of flight, such as an invasion disrupting the
pre-existing order of legitimacy conferral, without an accompanying organ to
organize the now-open spaces of
legitimacy, at the same time using weak sites of mobilization on miniscule
parts of the open body, such as that of women&rsquo;s autonomy, allowing for a
rhizomatic rise of monads on the now open-spaces on the body.
In the case of ISIS, as a monadic group, it is a subjectivity
formed out of pre-existing sites of
mobilization in revolutionary Salafism, but more broadly, as a current
against the projected universality of the Western subjectivity embodied
in that of the nation-state on the body. It is a subjectivity formed more
out of negation of an organ than an affirmation.</p>
<p>Universality is too broad a space on the body for any one set of organs to
occupy, and in its negation of its organs, the entire
subject comes under threat. The U.S. state in its belligerency may not
lead to its own collapse on the body, as attacks on its organs might,
but also threaten the international system, back to a rhizomatic form,
if its negation succeeds.</p>
