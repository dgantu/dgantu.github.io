# Dulguun Gantumur 

A 21 year old IR student at George Mason University interested in all things ranging from linguistics, obscure phiosophy, and Central Asia.

## Languages

I currently speak English, Mongolian,  Mandarin Chinese fluency, and activelylearning Azerbaijani. In the past I have studied Esperanto, Persian, and Hungarian. I plan to learn Russian after Azerbaijani.

I participated in the Critical Languages Scholarship program to go to Taiwan to study Mandarin but largely undertook self-study beforehand, as I am currently doing so with Azerbaijani.

## Philosophy

My current philosophical interests are in nationalism, ideology, identity, and communist theory. Through understanding communism, I wish to investigate how it shape political thought in current communist countries as well as common political discourse around the world.

For the former, I am the most familiar with "Socialism with Chinese Characteristics" but hope to learn how the Soviets organized their state later. For the latter, communist critiques of the current world system and especially the United States is notable, I seek to understand these critiques and how citizens are influenced by them.

## Central Asia

I regard the country of my birth, Mongolia, to be Central Asian, and seek to understand Mongolia's significance to Central Asia and vice versa. Inquiry into these topics has brought my previous interests of linguistics and philosophy into synthesis which I will be sharing through my posts here and into actual research papers.
