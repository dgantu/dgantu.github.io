      <description>&lt;p&gt;Despite Mongolic being a relatively young language family, there are a&#xA;surprising amount of archaisms and innovations one can spot even in basic vocabulary&#xA;such as numerals. With recent findings in the field, supported by data from neighboring languages,&#xA;these numerals&amp;rsquo; history are beginning to be understood.&#xA;The biggest aid has been the deciphering of Khitan, a language of a sister branch to Mongolic,&#xA;which helps reconstruct a deeper layer of Mongolic-Khitan languages (referred&#xA;to also as Serbi-Mongolic). But the study of the Tungusic languages, which have&#xA;had extensive contact with Para-Mongolic languages, also provides some clues&#xA;as to what these innovations may have replaced. Jurchen (among others) borrowings of Mongolic&#xA;teen numerals from 11-19 are especially useful into reconstructing archaic numerals lost to&#xA;modern Mongolic. Here I discuss Mongolic numbers which studies seem to suggest&#xA;could have looked very different in the past.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
