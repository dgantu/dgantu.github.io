      <title>Legitimacy as a Body-Without-Organs and Monads in International Relations</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The primary unit of international relations is the state.&#xA;The state forms with the monopolization of legitimate violence in an area.&#xA;The concept of legitimacy is imagined here as the Deleuzian concept of a&#xA;body-without-organs. The organs form the structure of how legitimacy is&#xA;used as a function.&#xA;The organization of organs upon the body, I call a monad, borrowing from&#xA;functional programming. Sites of mobilization, I define as separate&#xA;bodies but as part of legitimacy as a body as a whole, in&#xA;a more coherent sense, such as race, gender, religion, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Critique of Asian Identity in the US</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Asia is a Western notion. Etymologically it is theorized to have come from a Hittite &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Asia#Etymology&#34;&gt;word&lt;/a&gt; meaning “Northwest Anatolia” which was eventually borrowed into Greek from where it spread throughout Europe. From its root, it inherently comes from the perspective of the West looking East. Asia is not a concept born out of Asia.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This idea of “Asia” eventually found its way to the U.S. where it became a racialized concept denoting everyone hailing from the massive continent of Asia as they imagined it. Especially East Asians would form the popular imagination of what an Asian was, as their presence in both population figures and culture was much greater than other Asian ethnicities.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
