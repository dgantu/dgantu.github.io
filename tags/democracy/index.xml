      <title>Illiberal Democracy in Hungary</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hungary has experienced democratic backsliding in recent years, which stands out since it is a country in the EU, located at the center of Europe, and surrounded by strong democracies. Yet somehow, a strong wave of right-wing parties who openly declare themselves to be against “liberal democracy” has taken hold in the country, in stark contrast to the standard seen in the European Union. The prime minister of this party, Viktor Orbán declared that “illiberal democracy” is the country’s future, which led some to question what exactly this entails, and how such a concept has taken hold in a country surrounded by democracies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Democracy in the Chinese Context</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The People’s Republic of China’s ruling party, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) consistently and proudly calls itself a democracy. However, in the West, it is obvious to see that there is little parallel in what is defined as a democracy here, and the structure in China seen today. Equally puzzling, the democratic movements in China from the Democracy Wall movement in 1978-1979 to the Tiananmen Square protests in 1989 were cracked down on specifically with the rhetoric of democracy by the Chinese government. A closer look at the Chinese government’s ideology and their understanding of democracy reveals that there is an internal logic there within all of these parties which use the common language of “democracy.” The content of the language used shows that what “democracy” means to different groups varies wildly, and that using solely the term “democracy” may not be enough to describe fully the sheer diversity seen in China.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>KMT Factional Politics on Democratization in Taiwan</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ever since the Kuomintang (KMT) fled to the island of Taiwan in 1949, it has been the sole party in power until moves towards democratization in the 80s. While the present liberal democracy status of Taiwan is unquestionable, there are still remnants from the old party rule which prevents further democratization in Taiwanese politics. Every step of the way from the establishment of the Republic of China in Taiwan, to its eventual democratization, local factionalism has been a key element in the KMT’s hold on power and electoral strategy. It has been argued that while the support for the Democratical Progress Party (DPP) party, the current party in power, is based in ideology, the KMT’s support is still “faction based,” as in that it relies on local factional mobilization to elect officials. (Bosco 1994, p. 31) Despite its undemocratic nature, as it does not rely on the democratic process to get officials elected, in fact this was one of the factors which helped the Taiwanese political system to democratize since the party was willing to let political change happen knowing it had the network necessary to get their politicians elected. (Bosco 1994, p. 30) However, in the modern day, the KMT has still yet to become a “normal” party, since it still holds on to its strong local factional presence and mobilization strategies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
