      <description>The primary unit of international relations is the state. The state forms with the monopolization of legitimate violence in an area. The concept of legitimacy is imagined here as the Deleuzian concept of a body-without-organs. The organs form the function of the use of legitimacy. The organization of organs upon the body, I call a monad, borrowing from functional programming.&#xA;The monad arises in a rhizomatic way from sites of mobilization, on legitimacy, such as may be created by power vacuums, a line of flight, and finds in it a potential for mobilization and subjects them to the monad.</description>
