      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ever since the Kuomintang (KMT) fled to the island of Taiwan in 1949, it has been the sole party in power until moves towards democratization in the 80s. While the present liberal democracy status of Taiwan is unquestionable, there are still remnants from the old party rule which prevents further democratization in Taiwanese politics. Every step of the way from the establishment of the Republic of China in Taiwan, to its eventual democratization, local factionalism has been a key element in the KMT’s hold on power and electoral strategy. It has been argued that while the support for the Democratical Progress Party (DPP) party, the current party in power, is based in ideology, the KMT’s support is still “faction based,” as in that it relies on local factional mobilization to elect officials. (Bosco 1994, p. 31) Despite its undemocratic nature, as it does not rely on the democratic process to get officials elected, in fact this was one of the factors which helped the Taiwanese political system to democratize since the party was willing to let political change happen knowing it had the network necessary to get their politicians elected. (Bosco 1994, p. 30) However, in the modern day, the KMT has still yet to become a “normal” party, since it still holds on to its strong local factional presence and mobilization strategies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
